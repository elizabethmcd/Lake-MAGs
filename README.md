This repository contains scripts and workflows for reassembling and binning metagenomes from the historical time series of Lake Mendota, Trout Bog epliminion and hypolimnion, Mary Lake, Crystal Bog, and metagenomic/metatranscriptomic work for GEODES. These workflows are for use with the HTCondor systems on UW-Madison CHTC cluster and the DOE GLBRC cluster.
